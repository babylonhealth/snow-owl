/**
 * <b>5.3.5	Merge refinement</b><br/>
 * The normalized expression refinement from the "Normalize attribute values in refinement" process (5.3.2)
 * is merged with the combined definition from the "Merge definitions" process (5.3.4).<br/>
 * The rules for this process are the same as those for merging definitions (see 5.3.4) with the following additions.<br/><br/>
 * <b>5.3.5.1	Normalization of laterality</b><br/>
 * If an attribute representing a value for "laterality" (272741003) is present in the refinement and is applied to 
 * a focus concept that is not subsumed by "body structure" (123037004), the laterality attribute should be applied 
 * to any and every lateralizable "body structure" specified in the resulting refinement.<br/><br/>
 * <b>5.3.5.2	Normalization of non-context attributes applied in a context wrapper</b><br/>
 * If the focus concept is subsumed by "context-dependent categories" (364629017) and any attributes other than 
 * valid context attributes* are present in the refinement, these attributes are applied as additional refinement 
 * of the value of the "associated finding" (246090004) or "associated procedure" (363589002) attribute.<br/><br/>
 * <b>5.3.5.3	Completion of the definition merging</b><br/>
 * Once the refinement has been merged the resulting final refinement is passed to the "Create expression" process (5.3.6).<br/><br/>
 * 
 * <em>* The only valid context attributes are:<br/>
 * "associated finding" (246090004), "associated procedure" (363589002), "finding context" (2470590016), 
 * "procedure context" (2470591017), "temporal context" (2470592012) and "subject relationship context" (2470593019).</em>
