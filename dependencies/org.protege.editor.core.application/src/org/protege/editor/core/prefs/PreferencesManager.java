 * The preferences manager provides a global point for access to
 * application preferences and other sets of preferences.  Plugin
 * developers may use the preferences sets mechanisms to create and
 * store preferences for their own plugins.
 * <p/>
 * For plugins, typical use is to store preferences in a preference
 * set.  For example suppose a plugin stored data about the size of a
 * component - the xSize and the ySize.  To store these the plugin might
 * get hold of the <code>Preferences</code> object that stores these
 * particular preferences, for example, <code>getPreferencesForSet("org.mydomain.myplugin", "dimensions")</code>.
 * This would return the <code>Preferences</code> contained in the preference set "org.mydomain.myplugin" (i.e. the plugin's
 * set of preferences), which had the id "dimensions".  The plugin would then get hold of the xSize and the ySize attributes
 * using the method on the <code>Preferences</code> object.
