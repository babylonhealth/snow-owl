= Console command reference

== Introduction

This documents lists commands available to the system administrator when connecting to the OSGi console of a running 
Snow Owl Server instance using telnet or SSH. Instructions for setting up the console can be found in the section 
titled "`OSGi console`" of the Configuration guide.

NOTE: Depending on log configuration, the output shown following user-entered commands in the usage examples might only 
appear in the service log, located at `serviceability/logs/log.log` in the Snow Owl Server installation folder, or the 
export/import logs in folder `serviceability/logs/snowowl`.

== General

=== Getting help

To get a quick overview of all available commands, type `help` into the console:

--------------------------
osgi> help
---CDO commands---
       cdo list - list all active repositories
       cdo start - start repositories from a config file
       cdo stop - stop a repository
...
service - list all services in the service registry
  scope: vsh
  parameters:
     String   operation (list)

service - examine a service in the service registry
  scope: vsh
  parameters:
     String   operation (examine)
     long     service id

shutdown - shut down the kernel
  scope: vsh
--------------------------

The displayed list of commands are a mixture of application-specific and framework-specific operations; the following 
categories provide functionality related to the terminology server itself:

* Local code system datastore commands -- `localcodesystem`
* LOINC datastore commands -- `loinc`
* Mapping Set datastore commands -- `mappingset`
* Scripting Commands -- `script`
* MRCM commands -- `mrcm`
* Terminology registry commands -- `terminologyregistry`
* SNOMED CT OWL ontology commands -- `ontology`
* SNOMED CT importer commands -- `sctimport`
* Value Domain datastore commands -- `valueset`
* Diagnostic and maintenance commands -- `snowowl`
* Session management commands -- `session`

To narrow the command list down to a certain category, type the category name given above:

--------------------------
osgi> localcodesystem
--- Local code system datastore commands ---
       localcodesystem exportXL local_codesystems_excelfile_path - Exports local code...
       localcodesystem importXL local_codesystems_excelfile_path clear_database - ...
--------------------------

=== Disconnecting from the console

To leave the console (and keep the server running), type `disconnect`, then confirm the operation by pressing Enter. 
Alternatively, you can type "y" to confirm, or "n" to back out.

--------------------------
osgi> disconnect
Disconnect from console? (y/n; default=y) y

Connection closed by foreign host.
--------------------------

== Local code systems

=== Import local code systems from a spreadsheet

`localcodesystem importXL` imports local code system content from the specified Excel spreadsheet (with `.xls` or 
`.xlsx` extension). Required arguments are the spreadsheet path and the merge mode, expressed as an integer with three 
possible values:

[sidebar]
--
[start=0]
. "`clear`" -- all existing local terminology entries are removed from the terminology store first, then the contents 
of the spreadsheet are added;
. "`merge`" -- if the terminology store already contains a local terminology to be imported, metadata groups and local 
codes with the same identifiers will be unaffected, while new incoming elements (ex.: local codes, metadata keywords) 
are going to be added to the existing local terminology
. "`replace`" -- similar to merge, but when an existing local terminology is encountered, the existing content will 
be replaced by the spreadsheet's related content.
--

The administrator is also required to provide a user identifier; the given user ID will be displayed in the commit log 
as the importing user.

--------------------------
osgi> localcodesystem importXL /path/to/local_code_systems.xlsx 0
Impersonate operation as: info@b2international.com

... - Importing local code systems from excel file: /path/to/local_code_systems.xlsx
...
... - Clearing index data... 
... - Clearing index data successfully finished. 
... - Converted local code system ABCD with 9 codes. 
...
... - Updating terminology metadata.  
...
--------------------------

=== Export local code systems to a spreadsheet

`localcodesystem exportXL` will generate an Excel file in XLSX format, in which all local terminology metadata and 
codes will be presented on different worksheets. The only required argument is a destination path; the exported file 
will be added to this location on the server.

--------------------------
osgi> localcodesystem exportXL /path/to/exported_spreadsheet.xlsx

... - Exporting Local Code Systems to Excel started. Server-side file: /path/to/exported_spreadsheet.xlsx
...
... - Finished exporting Local Code Systems to Excel. 
--------------------------

== LOINC

=== Import LOINC vocabulary from a release archive

`loinc import` replaces existing LOINC terminology store content with the concepts and multi-axial hierarchy given 
in the specified input `.zip` archive. This command also requires a user identifier to be entered, which will be 
presented as the importing user in the commit information view.

--------------------------
osgi> loinc import /path/to/loinc_archive.zip
Impersonate operation as: info@b2international.com

... - LOINC import: 0%

--------------------------

== Mapping sets

=== Import mapping sets from a spreadsheet

`mappingset import` allows the administrator to import one or more mapping sets from the specified spreadsheet; the 
command also requires a merge setting (given as an integer). The selection and meaning of merge options are the same 
as the ones given in <<Import local code systems from a spreadsheet>>.

--------------------------
osgi> mappingset import /path/to/mapping_sets.xlsx 1
Impersonate operation as: info@b2international.com

... - Importing mapping sets from excel file: /path/to/mapping_sets.xlsx 
... - Processed excel sheet 1. First spreadsheet for mapping set 
... - Branch: MAIN Event: MappingSet:  new components added: 12 
... - Commit notification received for user info@b2international.com.
--------------------------

== Scripting

=== Execute Groovy script

`script run` parses and executes the specified Groovy script. Services will be provided by the running server instance,
similarly to the Groovy editing environment within the Snow Owl client.

Make sure to inspect the server log for any issues, as they might not be printed to the console output depending on the 
log configuration.

--------------------------
osgi> script run /home/user/IndexExample.groovy

[Systemic blood pressure]
Number of results for 'hyp' query term: 3566
[Hypertensive disorder, Hyperlipidaemia, Asthma]
Number of results for 'hyp' AND 'blood cell' query term: 100
Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant
White blood cell disorder
...
Red blood cell count, manual, peritoneal fluid
Red blood cell folate borderline high
ID          Label
425983008   Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant
54097007    White blood cell disorder
...
442218004   Red blood cell folate borderline high
--------------------------

== Machine-Readable Concept Model

=== Import MRCM rules from XMI file

`mrcm import` reads and applies rules from the specified source file. Note that as with regular editing of MRCM rules, 
only SNOMED CT concept and reference set editors opened after the import will display their output with the changes 
considered.

This command also requires the specification of a user identifier, which will be presented as the importing user in 
the commit information view.

--------------------------
osgi> mrcm import /path/to/mrcm_20131212143528517.xmi
Impersonate operation as: info@b2international.com

... - Importing MRCM rules...
...
... - Persisting changes... 
... - Changes have been successfully persisted. 
... - Branch: MAIN Event: SNOMED CT Changes: changed concepts: [123037004:Body structure], ... 
...
... - MRCM rule import successfully finished. 
--------------------------

=== Export MRCM rules to an XMI file

`mrcm export` creates a file named `mrcm_{timestamp}.xmi` in the directory given by the administrator. The command 
requires a user identifier which will be recorded in the user audit log.

--------------------------
osgi> mrcm export /path/to/export/folder
Impersonate operation as: info@b2international.com

... - Exporting MRCM rules...
... 
... - MRCM rule export successfully finished. 
--------------------------

== Terminology registry

=== List all imported terminologies

`terminologyregistry listall` displays information about terminologies and terminology extensions imported into the running server instance, 
including individual local code systems.

--------------------------
osgi> terminologyregistry listall

--------------------------

== SNOMED CT OWL ontology (reasoner)

=== Display available reasoners

To list the available reasoners and the preferred one (marked with an `*` symbol) one has to perform the following:

--------------------------
osgi> ontology list
 
   0 None [version: 4.1.0] (org.protege.editor.owl.NoOpReasoner)
   1 ELK 0.3.2 [version: 0.3.2] (org.semanticweb.elk.elk.reasoner.factory)
 * 2 MORe A (0.1.3) [version: 0.1.3] (org.semanticweb.more.MORe.reasoner.factory)
   3 MORe B (0.1.3) [version: 0.1.3] (org.semanticweb.more.MOReRLrew.reasoner.factory)
   4 FaCT++ [version: 1.6.2] (uk.ac.manchester.cs.owl.factplusplus.factplusplus-factory)
--------------------------

=== Change the active reasoner

To change the preferred reasoner on the server (in our case from `MORe A` to `FaCT++`), use the following command:

--------------------------
osgi> ontology select 4
  
   0 None [version: 4.1.0] (org.protege.editor.owl.NoOpReasoner)
   1 ELK 0.3.2 [version: 0.3.2] (org.semanticweb.elk.elk.reasoner.factory)
   2 MORe A (0.1.3) [version: 0.1.3] (org.semanticweb.more.MORe.reasoner.factory)
   3 MORe B (0.1.3) [version: 0.1.3] (org.semanticweb.more.MOReRLrew.reasoner.factory)
 * 4 FaCT++ [version: 1.6.2] (uk.ac.manchester.cs.owl.factplusplus.factplusplus-factory)
--------------------------
 
Note that this setting does not affect ongoing computations if they were started using a different reasoner.

=== Checking status of available reasoners

The command checks the presence and availability of all reasoners available on the server side. In case of the 
response below, all reasoners are available.

--------------------------
osgi> ontology check
All reasoner instances are available and ready for use.
--------------------------

Whenever any of the reasoners is not available, the output should contain the problematic reasoner identifier. 
Please note that reasoner identifiers may vary; also, if more than one reasoner reports a problem, a list of 
reasoner identifiers will be printed to the console:

--------------------------
osgi> ontology check
Couldn't initialize reasoner factory for ID 'unique.id.of.the.reasoner'.
--------------------------

For getting the original cause of the reasoner availability issue, one could dump the exception by appending 
the `-d` flag:

[source%nowrap]
--------------------------
osgi> ontology check -d
Couldn't initialize reasoner factory for ID 'unique.id.of.the.reasoner'.
  
com.b2international.snowowl.snomed.reasoner.exceptions.ReasonerException: Couldn't initialize reasoner factory for ID 'unique.id.of.the.reasoner'.

== SNOMED CT ==

=== Import reference sets in RF2 format from a release text file

Use `sctimport rf2_refset` to import one or more reference sets from an RF2 text file. All RF2 import modes (`FULL`, 
`SNAPSHOT` and `DELTA`) are available; certain reference set members can be excluded from being imported based on 
their reference set identifiers.

The following example imports a snapshot release file from the SNOMED CT International RF2 release, excluding two 
reference sets by identifier:

[source%nowrap]

=== Import reference sets in DSV format

`sctimport dsv_refset` imports a single reference set from text files in Delimiter Separated Values (DSV) format. The syntax is as follows:

--------------------------
sctimport dsv_refset <path> <hasHeader> <skipEmptyLines> <parentConcept>
--------------------------

<path>:: Specifies the file to be used for importing
<hasHeader>:: Set to `true` if the source text file has a header row, `false` otherwise
<skipEmptyLines>:: Set to `true` if the source text file has empty lines which should be ignored, `false` otherwise
<parentConcept>:: Set to an integer value specifying the parent of the imported reference set's identifier concept

Accepted values for parentConcept are:

[sidebar]
--
[start=0]
. Simple type 
. B2i examples
. KP Convergent Medical Terminology
. CORE Problem List
. Infoway Primary Health Care
--

The reference set name is determined by the input file name; as an example, `CamelCase.csv` will be converted to 
`Camel Case reference set`. An attempt will be made to interpret the first column of each line as a SNOMED CT 
concept identifier. If the identifier can be resolved, a member will be added to the reference set, otherwise 
an exception is thrown.

== Value Domain

=== Import value domains from a UMLS SVS XML file

`valueset import` works with value domain terminology content and also supports the three merge modes mentioned at 
the local code system import command. The administrator will be prompted for an importing user identifier, which is 
required for identification in the commit information view.

The two required arguments are the absolute path of the source XML file, and the selected merge mode (represented 
by an integer in the range of 0..2).

== Session management

=== Display connected users and session identifiers

To list all connected users (and the unique session ID), run the following OSGi command:

--------------------------
osgi> session users

User: akitta@b2international.com | session ID: 3
User: obali@b2international.com | session ID: 4
User: zstorok@b2international.com | session ID: 5
User: apeteri@b2international.com | session ID: 6
--------------------------

=== Send message to users

To send message to all connected users, use the following command:

--------------------------
osgi> session message ALL Some message from the administrator.

Message sent to akitta@b2international.com
Message sent to obali@b2international.com
Message sent to zstorok@b2international.com
Message sent to apeteri@b2international.com
--------------------------

All connected client will receive the message via a dialog.

For sending message to a subset of recipient users, execute the following OSGi command:

[source%nowrap]
--------------------------
osgi> session message obali@b2international.com,zstorok@b2international.com Message from the administrator to Orsi and Zsolt.

Message sent to obali@b2international.com
Message sent to zstorok@b2international.com
--------------------------

=== Restrict user logins

Administrator may restrict non-administrator user log in to the sever with the following:

--------------------------
osgi> session login disabled

Disabled non-administrative logins.
--------------------------

Users will not be able to connect to the server while non-administrator log in is disabled. Clients will receive the 
following when trying to connect to the server from the splash screen:

--------------------------
Logging in for non-administrator users is temporarily disabled.
--------------------------

Invoking this command will not disconnect any of the connected non-administrator users. The way how to disconnect 
clients from the server will be discussed below.

To re-enable non-administrator log in onto the server refer to the following command:

--------------------------
osgi> session login enabled

Enabled non-administrative logins.
--------------------------

The status can be checked with the following command:

--------------------------
osgi> session login status

Non-administrative logins are currently enabled.
--------------------------

=== Disconnect users

To disconnect a subset of connected users from the server, the following command should be performed:

--------------------------
osgi> session disconnect akitta@b2international.com,apeteri@b2international.com

User: akitta@b2international.com ,session id: 3 was disconnected.
User: apeteri@b2international.com ,session id: 6 was disconnected.
--------------------------

All disconnected users will receive a message about the lost connection. Then client application could be closed 
gracefully. This will not prevent users to reconnect the server.
 
The recommended way to ensure that none of the users are connected to the server when performing any single system 
administrator task is the following:

* Disable non-administrator log in in the server
* Notify users about the upcoming system admin operation
* Disconnect all users

== Repository management

=== Display terminology repositories

To list all available repositories and their identifiers, one should execute the following command:

[source%nowrap]
--------------------------
osgi> session repositories

   LOINC Store [ID: loincStore]
   Local Code System Store [ID: localterminologyStore]
   Terminology Metadata Store [ID: terminologyregistryStore]
   ICD-10 Store [ID: icd10Store]
   Value Set Store [ID: valuesetStore]
   ATC Store [ID: atcStore]
   SNOMED CT Store [ID: snomedStore]
   Mapping Set Store [ID: mappingsetStore]
   ICD-10-AM Store [ID: icd10amStore]
--------------------------

=== Display currently held locks

To view a table of acquired locks, their targets and owners, execute the command:

[source%nowrap]
--------------------------
osgi> session showlocks
No locks are currently granted on this server.

osgi> session lock allrepositories
Acquired lock for all repositories.
 
osgi> session showlocks
 
  Id | Lvl | Created on       | Locked area       | Owner context                                     
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0 |   1 | 2014-01-31 21:16 | All repositories  | Lock owner: System                                
     |     |                  |                   | Performing maintenance from the server console    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 osgi> session lock allrepositories
 Acquired lock for all repositories.
 
  Id | Lvl | Created on       | Locked area       | Owner context                                     
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0 |   2 | 2014-01-31 21:16 | All repositories  | Lock owner: System                                
     |     |                  |                   | Performing maintenance from the server console    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------

Locks can be acquired for different purposes, such as:

* administrative maintenance
* backup 
* saving editors
* classification

Their area of effect can also vary:

* all terminology stores
* a single terminology store
* a single branch of a particular terminology store

Once a lock owner obtains a lock, the associated area is available for their use only; others will receive indications
that someone else is already working on something which requires uninterrupted access to the target area. Lock attempts
on the same or overlapping areas will not be able to complete until the lock is released. 

The "Lvl" column indicates the "nesting" count of a granted lock; when someone holds a lock, they can lock the same 
area multiple times. Ownership is only released when the level decreases to 0.

=== Lock and release areas of terminology stores

To lock all terminology stores simultaneously, issue the following command:

--------------------------
osgi> session lock allrepositories
Acquired lock for all repositories.
--------------------------

If a conflicting lock has already been acquired by a different owner, the reason for not granting this request will be 
displayed in the response.

To lock all branches of a single terminology store, refer to the repository identifiers returned by the 
`session repositories` command:

--------------------------
osgi> session lock snomedStore
Acquired lock for repository 'snomedStore'.
--------------------------

Similarly, for locking a single branch of a single repository, type:

[source%nowrap]
--------------------------
osgi> session lock snomedStore MAIN/a
Acquired lock for branch 'MAIN/a' of repository 'snomedStore'.
 
osgi> session showlocks

  Id | Lvl | Created on       | Locked area                              | Owner context                                     
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0 |   1 | 2014-01-31 21:16 | All repositories                         | Lock owner: System                                
     |     |                  |                                          | Performing maintenance from the server console    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1 |   1 | 2014-01-31 21:30 | Repository 'snomedStore'                 | Lock owner: System                                
     |     |                  |                                          | Performing maintenance from the server console    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   2 |   1 | 2014-01-31 21:30 | Branch 'MAIN' of repository 'snomedStore'| Lock owner: System                                
     |     |                  |                                          | Performing maintenance from the server console    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------

The branch path argument is case sensitive; as an example, `main`, `Main`, `main/a` and `Main/a` branch paths would be
invalid arguments.

Releasing an owned lock can be performed by executing a corresponding `session unlock` command:

[source%nowrap]
--------------------------
osgi> session unlock snomedStore MAIN
Released lock for branch 'MAIN' of repository 'snomedStore'.
 
osgi> session showlocks

  Id | Lvl | Created on       | Locked area             | Owner context                                     
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0 |   1 | 2014-01-31 21:16 | All repositories        | Lock owner: System                                
     |     |                  |                         | Performing maintenance from the server console    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1 |   1 | 2014-01-31 21:30 | Repository 'snomedStore'| Lock owner: System                                
     |     |                  |                         | Performing maintenance from the server console    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------

NOTE: Regular save operations try to get the lock for their target repository and branch. If the administrator
has already taken over an area by using the commands above, a dialog will be displayed when the 
user tries to save after approx. 5 seconds of waiting for the lock to be granted.

=== Forcefully unlock stuck locks

If an operation gets stuck, or otherwise fails to release locks for which the System user is not the owner, other 
users may be blocked indefinitely as a result. To resolve the situation, one can forcefully unlock such locks 
by referring to their identifier shown in the table:

[source%nowrap]
--------------------------
osgi> session forceunlock 1
Forcefully released lock with identifier 1.
 
 osgi> session showlocks
 
  Id | Lvl | Created on       | Locked area             | Owner context                                     
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0 |   1 | 2014-01-31 21:16 | All repositories        | Lock owner: System                                
     |     |                  |                         | Performing maintenance from the server console    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------

To forcefully release all locks, use the command with the `all` argument instead of the identifier.

== Supporting indexes

Supporting indexes store additional data that is referenced across terminology stores, such as previous choices of 
users, bookmarks, and task metadata. Access to these items cannot be locked, however, a consistent snapshot of their 
contents can be taken and saved for backup purposes. Snapshots are only kept while the server is running; after a 
restart, only the latest data will be available. It is advised to release snapshots straight after a successful backup.

NOTE: The provided backup script performs the steps below for all available supporting indexes automatically.

=== Display supporting indexes

To list all available supporting index identifiers, issue:

--------------------------
osgi> index list
 
Index service identifier
--------------------------------
  previous_picks
  bookmarks
  tasks
--------------------------------
--------------------------

=== Create snapshot

Consistent snapshots can be referenced by their UUIDs, which is displayed when a new snapshot is created.

--------------------------
osgi> index createSnapshot tasks
Snapshot '885bded0-5e93-4f20-bdbd-aafd5434a41a' for service 'tasks' has been successfully created.
--------------------------

=== List snapshots

To get the list of currently available snapshots for any supporting index, run:

--------------------------
osgi> index listSnapshots tasks
 
Index snapshot identifier
--------------------------------
 885bded0-5e93-4f20-bdbd-aafd5434a41a
--------------------------------
--------------------------

=== List files in snapshots

To collect all files that make up a particular snapshot, execute the following command:

--------------------------
osgi> index listSnapshotFiles tasks 885bded0-5e93-4f20-bdbd-aafd5434a41a

 Files in snapshot '885bded0-5e93-4f20-bdbd-aafd5434a41a'
--------------------------------
 tasks/_1.si
 tasks/_0.si
 tasks/_1.cfs
 tasks/_1.cfe
 tasks/segments_3
 tasks/_0.cfs
 tasks/_0.cfe
--------------------------------
--------------------------

Files are displayed relative to the Snow Owl Server installation's `resources/index` folder.

=== Release created snapshot

To unreference files that might only be in use because a snapshot was taken, and free up disk space, run:

--------------------------
osgi> index releaseSnapshot tasks 885bded0-5e93-4f20-bdbd-aafd5434a41a
Snapshot 885bded0-5e93-4f20-bdbd-aafd5434a41a has been successfully released.
--------------------------

== Remote jobs

Remote jobs are long-running operations intended to be executed on the server; the requesting user's client need not 
be kept open while the job is active. The result of these computations can be checked immediately, or at a later time, 
if the results are still available for review. The administration console provides two commands for listing currently 
running remote jobs, and requesting cancellation of these items.

=== Display remote jobs

To list all currently scheduled, running, or finished remote jobs, type:

[source%nowrap]
--------------------------
osgi> remotejobs list

(Note that identifiers in the first column can change at any time if, for example, the initiator of the task removes 
a completed job from their list.)

=== Cancel remote job

To signal a remote job that it should finish its work at the closest possible occasion without completing it fully, 
use the following command with the identifier from the list displayed above. If `remotejobs list` was not invoked earlier, 
the following message will be printed to the console:

--------------------------
osgi> remotejobs cancel 0
Please retrieve the list of currently scheduled or running jobs first.
--------------------------

Otherwise, when a valid job identifier is given, the following output should appear:

--------------------------
osgi> remotejobs cancel 0
Requesting job 0 to cancel.
--------------------------

...and an additional invocation of `remotejobs list` should list the given job's status as "Cancel requested".

NOTE: Not all remote jobs are able to react to cancel requests.
