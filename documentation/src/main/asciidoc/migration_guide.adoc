= Data migration guide

== Introduction

This document lists the required data migration steps for each release.

== 5.0.0

Follow these intructions to migrate datasets created prior to 5.0.0:

WARNING: Make sure you execute the data migration process on a backup first before you try to migrate your production servers!

=== Steps

. Stop the currently running snow-owl and deploy a new v5.0.0 version
. Backup the <SO_DATADIR>/indexes directory for recovery in case of migration failure
. Change the following configuration values in *snowowl_config.yml* file:
.. Set _commitInterval_ from default _15 seconds_ to _15 minutes_ (value _900000_)
.. Set _translogSyncInterval_ from default _5 seconds_ to _5 minutes_ (value _300000_)
.. Set _revisionCache_ to _false_
.. You can find an example configuration in the *configuration/migration/5.0* subdirectory
. Change memory settings to fixed *12g* in the _<SO_HOME>/bin/dmk.sh_ file with JVM configuration _-Xms12g -Xmx12g_
. Start snow-owl v5.0.0
. Connect to the OSGi console via _telnet localhost 2501_
. Start the migration process with the command _snowowl reindex <repositoryId>_. For SNOMED CT, the repository identifier is _snomedStore_.

=== Troubleshooting

If the migration process fails, it prints out relevant messages in the console and the logs. The printed message contains information about the failed commit, with its commit timestamp. You can (re)start the migration process from the failed commit timestamp, if you specify the commit time at the end of the command as follows, _snowowl reindex snomedStore <failedCommitTimestamp>_.

NOTE: It is recommended to stop and restart the server before continuing a failed migration process.

== 4.7.0

There are two ways to migrate data from 4.6 to 4.7. Either run the provided SQL statements against the database or use the shell scripts which migrate the data in three steps.

=== SQL
The `migration_4.6_to_4.7/snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_terminology_snomed.sql` file contains the necessary SQL statements for the migration. Execute each SQL statement against the database to migrate your data.

=== Shell scripts
The `migration_4.6_to_4.7` folder contains three shell scripts for the migration.

The first script `snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_1_table_creation.sh` creates the new Code System tables for the given terminology. Use the following command to run the script:

--------------------------
./migration_4.6_to_4.7/snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_1_table_creation.sh admin snomed
--------------------------

The second script `snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_2_table_population.sh` populates the previously created tables with the necessary data. Use the following command to run the script:

--------------------------
./migration_4.6_to_4.7/snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_2_table_population.sh admin snomed SNOMEDCT sct
--------------------------

The third script `snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_3_old_table_deletion.sh` deletes the old Code System tables which are no longer needed. Use the following command to run the script:

--------------------------
./migration_4.6_to_4.7/snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_3_old_table_deletion.sh admin snomed
--------------------------

=== Index update
After the database migration, Code System and Code System Version indexes must be updated. In order to do this, start the terminology server with the `-Dsnowowl.reindex=true` VM argument. If the reindex argument is missing or false, the index update process is skipped.
